# Mavenmovies Database Analysis

This repository contains my analysis on the Mavenmovies database, which includes various tables such as actor, film, customer, and more. 
The analysis was done using MySQL commands and concepts such as JOINS, group by, and subqueries, and includes basic to advanced level queries. 

## About the Database

The Mavenmovies database was obtained from OdinSchool, where I am pursuing a Data Science course. 
The database includes various tables with sample data that can be used for practicing MySQL commands and concepts.

## Repository Contents

- `mavenmovies_database.sql`: SQL file containing the Mavenmovies database schema and sample data
- `mavenmovies_queries.sql`: SQL file containing a series of queries used to explore and extract insights from the Mavenmovies database
- `README.md`: This file

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. You can then import the `mavenmovies_database.sql` file 
into a MySQL server to create the Mavenmovies database. After importing the database, you can use the `mavenmovies_queries.sql` file to practice SQL commands and concepts.

## Usage

The `mavenmovies_queries.sql` file contains a series of queries that explore and extract insights from the Mavenmovies database. The queries cover a range
 of topics and difficulty levels, and are intended to be used as a learning resource for practicing MySQL commands and concepts. To use the queries, 
simply import the file into a MySQL server and run the queries.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to practice my skills in SQL and data analysis. I hope that this repository will be useful to others
 who are learning SQL or looking for a database to practice on. Please feel free to leave any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
